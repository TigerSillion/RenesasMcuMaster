# Review Rules

## Output format
- Findings first, sorted by severity.
- Severity levels: S0 (critical), S1 (major), S2 (minor).
- Each finding must include `path:line` and impact.

## Expectations
- Prioritize correctness, regressions, and missing tests.
- Keep summary short; avoid burying defects.
- If no findings, state that explicitly and list residual risks.
